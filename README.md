# Hotel-Booking-and-Management-Platform
Hotel Booking Platform – Group project developing a hotel booking system with full documentation including UML diagrams, risk assessment, project/testing plans, and system architecture.

## Project Overview
This group project focused on designing and planning a **Hotel Booking Platform**, covering the full software development lifecycle. Our team created all necessary documentation, diagrams, and plans to demonstrate how the system would function, be tested, and maintained.

The goal was to practice **end-to-end project development** — from analysis and planning to design, testing, and risk management.
